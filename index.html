  <h1><strong>Your donations can help needy people.</h1>
    <div class="content">You are intelligent and have a good life. Now, that is perhaps something you are gifted with or some unknown force makes you achieve your dreams. But then, you should show gratitude towards the universe because it has given you in life what you want.

        It does not make sense to donate to a deity because deities are neither hungry nor need financial help. In fact, you should help fellow humans who are in need. And that would be the most intelligent thing that you could ever do.
        
        Donating would mean showing a sense of responsibility towards the betterment of the world. If you think that all the poverty and the problems would vanish through propagandas that are carried out by various organizations and governments, then you are not thinking in the right direction because propagandas are only ideas. In fact, you need to take the right action now.</div>
